HelloWorldButInSpace

## Overview
This project consists of two main components: the client and the server. The client is a React application managed using Vite, and the server is built with Express.js. Below you'll find instructions on how to set up and run both parts of the application. We want to encourage space exploration education and cultivate space interest.  We aim to show people that you can explore space, even from earth, through our app! Our app centralizes space object location information for space exploring enthusiasts to plan their outdoor adventures, stargazing sessions, and space exploration with their telescopes.
